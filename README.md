# ðŸš¬ json-to-ts.nvim

A plugin for lazy people who don't want to write typescript types by hand. This plugin will convert JSON to TypeScript types.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

- Neovim >= **0.8.0** (needs to be built with **LuaJIT**)

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Install the plugin with your preferred package manager:

[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
    "Redoxahmii/json-to-ts.nvim",
    lazy = false,
    priority = 1000,
    opts = {},
  }
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

- It currently imports with a default keymap of `<leader>cu` to convert the JSON to TypeScript types.
- It also has a command `:ConvertJSONtoTS` that does the same thing.

## ðŸ‘· Features to come

- [ ] Create a read only buffer with the types.
- [ ] Add the ability to add the types to the current buffer.
