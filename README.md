# ðŸš¬ json-to-types.nvim

A plugin for lazy people who don't want to write typescript types by hand. This plugin will convert JSON to types.
Currently it only supports TypeScript but other language support will be added soon.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

- Neovim >= **0.8.0** (needs to be built with **LuaJIT**)

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Install the plugin with your preferred package manager:

[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
    "Redoxahmii/json-to-types.nvim",
    build = "sh install.sh npm",
    keys = {
      {
        "<leader>cu",
        "<CMD>ConvertJSONtoTS<CR>",
        desc = "Convert JSON to TS",
      },
      {
        "<leader>ct",
        "<CMD>ConvertJSONtoTSBuffer<CR>",
        desc = "Convert JSON to TS in buffer",
      },
    },
  }
```

- Provide your installer in the build command.Instead of `npm` you can pass whatever you are using such as `yarn`.

## ðŸš€ Usage

- Reason for appending `Types-` before the file name is to avoid overwriting if there is an already `.ts` file in the same directory with the same name.
- Use the command `:ConvertJSONtoTS` to convert the JSON to TypeScript types and save the file immediately.
- Use this command `:ConvertJSONtoTSBuffer` to convert the JSON to TypeScript types and open them in a split buffer to check first before saving the file.
- You can also make keybindings for the mentioned commands by referring to the method provided above.

## ðŸ‘· Features to come

- [x] Create a read only buffer with the types.
- [ ] Support for other languages.
